# tekaim
A simple tool to take and upload screenshots to teknik.io

## Usage

Run `tekaim` and make a selection. After a few seconds, the URL to your image will appear. By default, tekaim will upload to [teknik.io](https://www.teknik.io/).

## Dependencies

By default, tekaim depends on [maim](https://github.com/naelstrof/maim) for screenshots and [curl](https://github.com/curl/curl) for uploading. If you want to use something different, you can configure screenshot and upload commands and arguments in `config.json`.

## Why the dumb name?

teknik + maim = tekaim

Creative, I know.
